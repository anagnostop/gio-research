abstract: "This paper explains the design of a social network analysis framework, developed under DARPA’s SocialSim program, with novel architecture that models human emotional, cognitive and social factors. Our framework is both theory and data-driven, and utilizes domain expertise. Our simulation effort helps understanding how information flows and evolves in social media platforms. We focused on modeling three information domains: cryptocurrencies, cyber threats, and software vulnerabilities for the three interrelated social environments: GitHub, Reddit, and Twitter. We participated in the SocialSim DARPA Challenge in December 2018, in which our models were subjected to an extensive performance evaluation for accuracy, generalizability, explainability, and experimental power. This paper reports the main concepts and models, utilized in our social media modeling effort in developing a multi-resolution simulation at the user, community, population, and content levels."

summary: "In this paper we lay out the design of a social network analysis framework, developed under DARPA’s SocialSim program. Our novel architecture models human emotional, cognitive and other social factors. Furthermore, we showcase results of modeling cryptocurrencies, cyber threats, and software vulnerabilities for three interrelated social environments, namely GitHub, Reddit, and Twitter."
