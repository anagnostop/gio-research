  abstract = {In machine learning, the notion of multi-objective model selection
	(MOMS) refers to the problem of identifying the set of Pareto-optimal
	models that optimize by compromising more than one predefined objectives
	simultaneously. This paper introduces SPRINT-Race, the first multi-objective
	racing algorithm in a fixed-confidence setting, which is based on
	the sequential probability ratio with indifference zone test. SPRINT-Race
	addresses the problem of MOMS with multiple stochastic optimization
	objectives in the proper Pareto-optimality sense. In SPRINT-Race,
	a pairwise dominance or non-dominance relationship is statistically
	inferred via a non-parametric, ternary-decision, dual-sequential
	probability ratio test. The overall probability of falsely eliminating
	any Pareto-optimal models or mistakenly returning any clearly dominated
	models is strictly controlled by a sequential Holm's step-down family-wise
	error rate control method. As a fixed-confidence model selection
	algorithm, the objective of SPRINT-Race is to minimize the computational
	effort required to achieve a prescribed confidence level about the
	quality of the returned models. The performance of SPRINT-Race is
	first examined via an artificially constructed MOMS problem with
	known ground truth. Subsequently, SPRINT-Race is applied on two real-world
	applications: 1) hybrid recommender system design and 2) multi-criteria
	stock selection. The experimental results verify that SPRINT-Race
	is an effective and efficient tool for such MOMS problems. MATLAB
	code of SPRINT-Race is available at https://github.com/watera427/SPRINT-Race.},
