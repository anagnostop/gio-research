**Jan 26, 2023.** A [feature](https://news.fit.edu/academics-research/university-study-examines-viral-probability-of-social-media-posts/), which Florida Tech News ran last November about our work on predicting the virality of online content, was picked up by the Space Coast Daily (an online news outlet serving Brevard County, FL), TechXplore (part of the ScienceX network with its global reach of over 10M monthly readers) and Leadersnet Deutschland (German business news site with 1M monthly page views).
