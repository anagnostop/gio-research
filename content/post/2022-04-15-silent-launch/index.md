**Apr 15, 2022.** It has been a long while since our group has been without a web presence and we hope to change this soon. Towards this, we are deploying today an alpha version of our new website via [Netlify](https://netlify.com) using a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template provided by [wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) (George "Geo" Cushen).

 We will continue working on it until we beat it into a shape that suits our purposes. Until then,... patience :smile:.
